# TickForge

**TickForge** is a deterministic 2D simulation engine focused on rule-based systems and real-time visualization.

It is designed for developers, researchers, and engineers who want to experiment with autonomous entities, simulation rules, and real-time behaviors without the overhead of a full game engine.

## Key Features

- Fixed-step deterministic simulation
- Rule-based behavior system (JSON-driven)
- Real-time 2D visualization
- Event-driven architecture
- Designed for inspection and experimentation

## What TickForge Is

- A simulation sandbox
- A rule-driven engine
- A tool for experimentation and prototyping

## What TickForge Is Not

- A full game engine
- A rendering framework
- A high-level editor (yet)

## Status

TickForge is currently in early development.  
The API is unstable and subject to change.

## Roadmap

- Core simulation loop
- Entity and system architecture
- Rule evaluation engine
- Live inspection and debug overlay
- Sample simulations
